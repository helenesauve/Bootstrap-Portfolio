# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This is the third challenge of the Front-End Web Developer boocamp and this time the task is to recreate the [portfolio](https://helenesauve.github.io/Portfolio-challenge2/) from the previous challenge, using Bootstrap.
To do so, I used Bootstrap 4 and modified a few elements based on the task at hand.
For example, I added a skills section, a footer and modified the hero (jumbotron) slightly.

From Bootstrap I used:

- a navbar
- a jumbotron
- Cards / Grid
- a footer
